## How to create a pull request?

- Before you start, make sure to create a fork from `develop` branch, since there are the latest changes.
- When you add a new commit, make sure to follow the best practices for a git commit.
- Create a pull request with all the necessary information, what issue your pull request fixes and a well documented description of it.
- When creating a pull request, always target the develop branch.
